Of course, there's a lot more out there that I do know but didn't show/explain on here such as numbered lists, hyperlinks, math symbols, etc. **but** hopefully I've shown you enough to make you think: \"*Maysey knows her Markdown pretty well.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also like to point out that this isn't **all** that Markdown can do. There are definitely some limitations in what general Markdown (by using a few simple symbols) can do but with the help of other code (i.e. HTML or CSS), we can do even more! This includes things like changing the font colour, font style, font size, underlining, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "> (HTML) To colour text, use `<font color=insert_colour_here> insert_text_here </font>`   \n",
    "> (HTML) To underline text, use `<u> insert_text_here </u>`   \n",
    "> (CSS) To change the font, use `<span style=\"font-family:insert_font_name;\"> insert_text_here </span>`  \n",
    "> (CSS) To change the size, use `<span style=\"font-size:insert_size_here;\"> insert_text_here </span>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**BUT** we must be careful when using HTML and CSS tags because it's not always supported! For example, when you view this Python Notebook on Jupyter lab, the tag formatting works fine, but when viewed on GitHub, the tags do not work and just show up as plain text 😕"
