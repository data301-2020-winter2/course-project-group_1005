Bungie keeps adding DLC very often and with the new season coming up im very excited to grind the game. Notes for new players out there- Is a very grindy game and requires a lot of time to get the good gear and weapons. There are weekly events that offer powerful gear to keep you active.

The Story is emotional and rich and is worth every second. The online portion of this game has gotten better since the original release in 2018; However, there is still a lot to be desired.

Its price is high for good reason. The storage space it takes is worth it. RDR2 is a game that has such an immersive story line. It’s a long, but damn near perfect game. This is the first game that has made me bawl like a baby. If you get this game, or if you’ve already played it, you’ll understand why I cried... That said, I highly recommend this game.

The story is the most ambitious and inventive campaign ive ever played, it's a must play for anyone who loves Guns, Horses, cowboys, or video games. The Story is emotional and rich and is worth every second. The online portion of this game has gotten better since the original release in 2018; However, there is still a lot to be desired. Rockstar is slowly updating it, but this game is worth it for the story mode alone.   \n",
       "1  Red Dead Redemption 2. Is there anything I can say that will suffice in describing this masterpiece??? RDR2 is SUCH a good game. It’s definitely my favorite game. Its price is high for good reason. The storage space it takes is worth it. RDR2 is a game that has such an immersive story line. It’s a long, but damn near perfect game. This is the first game that has made me bawl like a baby. If you get this game, or if you’ve already played it, you’ll understand why I cried... That said, I highly recommend this game. Again, damn near perfect.   \n",

Online is pretty good too although too much grinding just to get a single role which is one of the main core content in online, and there are so many more roles to get. Too much grinding isnt gonna make players stay for long. AND seasonal PASSS? NANI? Aims too much for a cowboy game imo.   \n",

Other players aren't nice. They're abusive, they're mean, and they try to bait you.\\n\\nI wish there was a PvE mode for just sailing around, because that is chill. Doesn't have to be rewarding. Just chill sailing would be nice.   \n",

You don't quite have enough time each day to do everything you want, but it's such a forgiving game, it isn't nearly as stressful as it could have been. Still, I highly recommend having a villager guide on their likes/dislikes to streamline relationship building.\\n\\nOnce you get decent sprinklers for your crops, the mood becomes much more relaxed and you can pass your time doing whatever appeals to you the most. Very relaxing at this point, to where I've purchased the game on 2 platforms now and played to completion.

       "2  Charming little fantasy farm crafting/sim/dating game. You don't quite have enough time each day to do everything you want, but it's such a forgiving game, it isn't nearly as stressful as it could have been. Still, I highly recommend having a villager guide on their likes/dislikes to streamline relationship building.\\n\\nOnce you get decent sprinklers for your crops, the mood becomes much more relaxed and you can pass your time doing whatever appeals to you the most. Very relaxing at this point, to where I've purchased the game on 2 platforms now and played to completion. Some minor gripes on targeting and combat, but you learn to work around these quirks.   \n",

       "      <td>This game is a worthy heir to the dedicated simbin/rfactor community. It plays like a sim and is presented like Forza for the PC.\\nMultiplayer is already implemented and campaign mode is coming. It's not a motorsports game like Race 07 or the codemasters f1 series it's more of a world of cars experience.\\n\\nThis one is very rewarding if you have a good steering wheel setup, standard transmission cars will teach you to liftoff when shifting even if you are playing with an automatic clutch while double clutch paddle shifting cars will not need lift off. The game automatically adjusts settings so that road cars have 900 degrees of wheel rotation but race cars have suitably less.\\n\\nTracks and cars so far have a heavy Italian flavor which is good because it offers some old favorites like Monza and also fresh new circuits. This is the game for Lotus and Ferrari fans. Pagani, Fiat, and BMW are also well represented.\\n\\nHas a very annoying penalty system which can, thankfully, be disabled.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Bought myself a logitech G27 off FB marketplace for $230 including shipping with H shifter as well. After going through the inevitable process of drivers and calibration including LUT mapping, I found it was just extremely worth the effort. \\n\\nThis has already been 2 days worth of fun and could have easily been more. \\n\\nAlso the content manager plugin is actually really generous with the idea to unlock all features you can donate literally any amount. Highly recommend as it allows all the ease of mods. What initially interesting me was Aussie Drift Co's eseries which featured calder park, the track I live local to and have been to drifts for. Being able to drift my local spots in Australia without even leaving home is just a fantastic way to spend time, especially during current Covid troubles and spending more time at home. Still ironing out some kinks with how to drift and I think I'll get a USB E-brake for the added sim immersion and drift accuracy. \\n\\nNot only that but doing some casual races and drags are pretty cool too, can really work on your reaction speeds.\\n\\n9.9/10 on pretty much everything. For an older game, that shaders patch in content manager is absolutely incredible at making the cars look really good. Tracks however really just come down to the people who made them so nothing you can do about that.\\n\\nGreat game, if you can save up some money for the game and a wheel over time you won't regret the fun you get from it. And if you already have a half decent wheel or better? Why do you not have this game yet? Best drift sim on the market besides Forza and even then, I think I like the look of Assetto better. Then again I'm biased and haven't tried Forza yet.</td>\n",

It plays like a sim and is presented like Forza for the PC.\\nMultiplayer is already implemented and campaign mode is coming. It's not a motorsports game like Race 07 or the codemasters f1 series it's more of a world of cars experience.\\n\\nThis one is very rewarding if you have a good steering wheel setup, standard transmission cars will teach you to liftoff when shifting even if you are playing with an automatic clutch while double clutch paddle shifting cars will not need lift off. The game automatically adjusts settings so that road cars have 900 degrees of wheel rotation but race cars have suitably less.\\n\\nTracks and cars so far have a heavy Italian flavor which is good because it offers some old favorites like Monza and also fresh new circuits. This is the game for Lotus and Ferrari fans. Pagani, Fiat, and BMW are also well represented.\\n\\nHas a very annoying penalty system which can, thankfully, be disabled.   \n",

       "4  Bought myself a logitech G27 off FB marketplace for $230 including shipping with H shifter as well. After going through the inevitable process of drivers and calibration including LUT mapping, I found it was just extremely worth the effort. \\n\\nThis has already been 2 days worth of fun and could have easily been more. \\n\\nAlso the content manager plugin is actually really generous with the idea to unlock all features you can donate literally any amount. Highly recommend as it allows all the ease of mods. What initially interesting me was Aussie Drift Co's eseries which featured calder park, the track I live local to and have been to drifts for. Being able to drift my local spots in Australia without even leaving home is just a fantastic way to spend time, especially during current Covid troubles and spending more time at home. Still ironing out some kinks with how to drift and I think I'll get a USB E-brake for the added sim immersion and drift accuracy. \\n\\nNot only that but doing some casual races and drags are pretty cool too, can really work on your reaction speeds.\\n\\n9.9/10 on pretty much everything. For an older game, that shaders patch in content manager is absolutely incredible at making the cars look really good. Tracks however really just come down to the people who made them so nothing you can do about that.\\n\\nGreat game, if you can save up some money for the game and a wheel over time you won't regret the fun you get from it. And if you already have a half decent wheel or better? Why do you not have this game yet? Best drift sim on the market besides Forza and even then, I think I like the look of Assetto better.

I really enjoyed the story and all of the characters, I was pleasantly surprised with the change of tone on the final expansion; everything just felt so eerie in the First, compared to the Warrior of Light's fantastic adventures with their friends in the Source, you know just liberating countries, toppling primals and tyrants.   \n",
