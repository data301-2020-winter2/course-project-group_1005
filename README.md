## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

#### Why are you interested in this topic or dataset?
Steam is a massive online store for video games that heavily impacts both gamers and developers alike. This data is not only interesting to our group, but is also relevant to many other students in the class due to the popularity video games and the impact of reviews. The dataset could even be used in analyses by game companies to find correlations between reviews and other statistics.

#### What do you hope to do with your analytics project?
Our team hopes to create a visualisation and analysis of Steam review data to potentially find interesting correlations between review content and other factors such as the reviewer's hours played or whether they received the game for free. While our goals are mainly fun and learning in this project, this data could potentially be used for full-scale analysis of user behaviour.

#### Do you have any questions you specifically want to explore?
The dataset offers many avenues of exploration of the data. However, these are some questions we have been considering:
1. Is there any correlation between receiving a game for free and the positivity of review?
2. How do the most common words differ across different 5 star reviews?
3. How do reviews differ across the 5 genres?

#### Could you imagine building a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset?
There are many comparison options to choose from in this dataset that will allow us to generate a Dashboard that is visually appealing and contains plenty of data. For example, we would love to lay out some charts categorized by genre, comparing attributes of reviews between them.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset is from user 'Mikeemes' on Kaggle, a data scientist from Toronto, Canada. Our dataset contains reviews from some of the most popular games on Steam. The reviews include data such as review text, rating, votes up/down, whether the game purchased or gifted, etc. The dataset was created on October 14, 2020. The primary purpose for this dataset is for personal interest, although it could also be used to determine and correlation between two variables. For example, if receiving a game for free has any effect on the score that a reviewer gives to a game. The dataset was collected using Steam's API.
